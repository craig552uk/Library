# Library
The process for the sharing of content that you feel other Jadu users may find relevant consists of:

1. Fork the Jadu Library project & clone it locally.
2. Create an upstream remote.
3. We recommend creating a branch for each service you wish to share content for (remember to sync your local copy before you branch!).
4. Do the work and write meaningful but concise commit messages.
5. Push your work up to your origin repository.
6. Create a new Pull Request (PR) within GitHub.

At this point, you're new content will be with us for review. We feel it would be in everyone's interest if we review and accept new / changed content prior to accepting any Pull requests. Once accepted, we will then add the relevant content into the Jadu Library website directory for ease of being located in the future by our customers.

We aim to comment on pull requests within three business days where possible (and, typically, will do so within one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements prior to accepting your Pull request in the interest of the wider community.
